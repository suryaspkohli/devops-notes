First part from https://blog.bluematador.com/posts/postman-how-to-install-on-ubuntu-1604/

    wget https://dl.pstmn.io/download/latest/linux64 -O postman.tar.gz
    sudo tar -xzf postman.tar.gz -C /opt
    rm postman.tar.gz
    sudo ln -s /opt/Postman/Postman /usr/bin/postman

But when launching postman from command prompt got an error:
    [root@localhost Downloads]# postman
    postman: error while loading shared libraries: libXss.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Found a solution at: https://www.centos.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=61219
    yum install libXScrnSaver-1.2.2-6.1.el7.x86_64
Then launch postman from command prompt and it will bring up the Postman GUI
Killing the open terminal will terminate Postman

You can also create a postman.desktop file to add Postman to the list of Applications in the Gnome desktop
vim /usr/share/applications/postman.desktop
create postman.desktop as follows
      [Desktop Entry]
      Encoding=UTF-8
      Name=Postman
      Exec=postman
      Icon=/opt/Postman/resources/app/assets/icon.png
      Terminal=false
      Type=Application
      Categories=Development
      
Once postman has been made available to the Applications Menu on the Gnome Desktop, it can be added to the Applications/Favorites menu
* Select the "Applications/Activities Overview" menu item
* Select the "Show Applications" icon
* Make sure the "All" button is selected then right click the Postman application and from the context menu, select the "Add to Favorites" menu item
* Postman is now available from the "Applications/Favorites" menu item.
